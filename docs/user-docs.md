### Concepts
#### Democracy
Democracies are at the core of the website. They are user-defined, except for the root, or site-wide democracy. The root democracy manages the site-wide code of conduct, voting algorithms, procedures and the creation/deletion of all other democracies.

##### Content
Each democracy maintains content. The content is determined by the context of the democracy. For example, the content of a democracy made for a government, might be it's legislation, by-laws or budgets. The content of a democracy made for some housemates, might be bill or chore schedules. The content of a democracy made for a research group, might be a data structure containing arguments about or results of experiments. All that's required, is that the content is in JSON format.

##### Inheritance
Democracies can have child democracies. These can be useful for subcommittees or other smaller groups within a democracy. All democracies have a parent, except for the root (site-wide) democracy. The root democracy is the default parent for a democracy, unless it is made under another.
